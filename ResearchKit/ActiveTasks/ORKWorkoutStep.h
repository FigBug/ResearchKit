 The `ORKWorkoutStep` is a step that can be used to group a set of active steps to lead the user
 through a workout. 
 
 For example, this is used in the Cardio Challenge task to instruct the user to do a 6-minute walk.
 
 As a part of running this step, the `ORKWorkoutStepViewController` will attempt to start a workout
 session, provided that the user has an Apple Watch and the watch app is installed. If the user has 
 an Apple Watch, then the workout will include collecting data on the heart rate from the watch.
 
 As a part of this step, the workout will insert an `ORKHeartRateCaptureStep` before and after the 
 active steps to measure the user's heart rate before and after the workout.

 This is the main initializer for this step. To use, include the steps that define the workout 
 instructions in the `motionSteps` parameter. Optionally, include a custom `restStep` with 
 custom text and/or duration. If included, the `restStep` will be copied with a new identifier
 and inserted before the motion steps. It will also be included after the motion steps. In this 
 way, the user's heart rate will be recorded before and after the workout by using the phone 
 camera. If `nil`, then the `restStep` will be instantiated and included using the default 
 parameters for an `ORKHeartRateCaptureStep`.
 
 If available, a workout session will also be started on user's Apple Watch. To start a workout 
 session from the Apple Watch, the application must include a watch app that implements the workout.
